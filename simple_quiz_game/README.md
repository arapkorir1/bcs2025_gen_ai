# Simple Quiz Game

A progressive multiple-choice AI trivia quiz, demonstrating the evolution from procedural Python to a graph-based, AI-integrated application using the Jac programming language.

## Key Concepts

- **Object-Spatial Programming (OSP):** Questions modeled as a graph structure.
- **Scale-Agnosticism:** Run locally, as a server, or on the cloud.
- **AI Integration:** Uses byLLM for dynamic, educational hints.
